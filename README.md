## Project Description
Experience the thrill of visiting an animal shelter from the comfort of your Terminal! Upon entry, choose whether you have come to adopt a new pet or surrender one you own.

Sign in with your email address. If you've been here before, we have a history of your visits and a record of the pets you have adopted or surrendered. If you've never been here, you will be asked to fill out a short form (just your name) to start your own record with the shelter.

If you're adopting, browse all of our available pets, choose one you like, sign our adoption agreement, and take your pet home!

If you're surrendering, tell us a little bit about your pet and we'll be happy to take it off your hands.
